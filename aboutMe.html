                    <p>My Name is Justin Shaw. I was born and raised here in Calgary, Alberta Canada. Ever since 2016, I have been involved in computer coding. I started learning python in school and moved on to HTML and CSS the following year. I really enjoyed this and decided I would go to school for it and I fell in love even more than before building and designing websites. This passion has brought me here today, starting my own website and freelancing business. </p>

                    <p>With my love for web designing, I wanted to give people the ability to have the website of their dreams for whatever they want it for. I'll build anything you wish for with 110% of my abilities. I am always learning new tricks and coming up with new ideas to implement into websites.</p>
                    
                    <p>When I'm not working on any new projects or client websites. I'm at home with my cat, playing games with my friends, or hanging out with the person I love most. I like to ride my motorbike wherever I need to in the summer and visit nature's best destination within a day trip.</p>
